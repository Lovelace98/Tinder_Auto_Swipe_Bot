## PROBLEM
A client had a problem swiping spending much time per day swiping through tinder to like others' profile. Some times he spend hours doing this boring repetitive task. He hired a freelancer python developer to help him solve this problem 

## SOLUTION 
He reached out to me and I built him a bot that does this repetitive task in minutes. This bot automatically logs into tinder, uses facebook to log in, clicks on allow cookes and location and then it starts with the liking process.
